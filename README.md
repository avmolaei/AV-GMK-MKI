The AV-GMK MK I is the first iteration of the AVlabs AV-GMK, the AVlabs "normal Gaming Mechanical Keyboard.

It differs from previous AVlabs projects by the fact that it has a normal ISO AZERTY layout. However, the alpha keys are in a ortholinear layout.
Based on the EE and SW arch of the AV-RK MK2

Epic RGB lighting powered by SK6812-mini LEDs

Compatible with MX style switches.

  
  

## TODO: shit to fix:

  

FW: only the left PCA is functional now. No RGB modes besides a default rainbow. Also fix the same shit as the AV-RK MK2

  
  

PCB: The "-" Key on the numpad is rotated 90Â° for some reason.

All stabilizer footprints are messed up, the radius of the hole for the clip is too small and the length between both mounting posts are fucked. Plastic post can be chopped down, and the other one can be screwed and it works normally, for peace of mind a slight point of glue can be added.

The stabilizer holes on the backspace key are way too small.

more LEDs should be added. while 1 LED/key is standard on most keyboard, it feels "empty" near big keys like the spacebar.

Add kailh choc footprints next to the MX holes for optimal switch compatibility

  

CAD: do cad, duh.
